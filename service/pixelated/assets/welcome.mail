Welcome to Pixelated Mail a modern email with encryption. Pixelated Mail is an open source project that aims to provide secure email on the browser with all the functionality we've come to expect of a modern email client.

How to use it
Pixelated Mail should provide functionality that is similar to what you've come to expect of your email software. To the left, you will find a navigation bar that provides access to all your mailboxes and tags. Clicking on them will load the corresponding messages on the middle pane - the mail list. Clicking on a message will load it on this pane, but you know it already!

To compose a message look for the big blue button on the top left. You can add tags to received messages by clicking on the "+" sign under the message subject. You can also find the encryption status of messages just above the sender/recipient information.

A bit more about Pixelated
Pixelated is an open source project licensed under AGPL 3.0. It is composed of 3 main parts, the User Agent (what you are using right now), the Dispatcher (what allows you to log in with different accounts to the same instance) and the Platform (which provides the email service you will use to send and receive messages - the server behind the @ sign on your new mail address). You can learn more by visiting https://pixelated-project.org/.

About this message and understanding examples of message status
This message was not encrypted, in other words, it could have been read by others at some point during transmission.
However you can check the authenticity of this message, because the message has a certified sender.
Whether it is green, it means that the text you are reading has not changed on the way until delivered to you.

Enjoy your secure messaging!
